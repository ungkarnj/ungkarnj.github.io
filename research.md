## Smartphone-based platform for micro and nanoparicles sizing
<img src="img/lumisizer.jpg" width="400" alt="lumisizer"> <br/>
Micro- and nanoparticle sizing plays a vital role in fields such as diagnostics, water treatment, and micro/nanomaterial synthesis, yet conventional differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) systems remain bulky, non-portable, and unable to resolve multi-modal size distributions. To overcome these limitations, we developed a compact, low-cost smartphone-based DDM platform using a reversed lens and 3D-printed housing to create a portable microscope capable of non-destructive, label-free particle sizing. By capturing Brownian motion of dispersed particles and analyzing image sequences with a differential dynamic algorithm coupled to non-negative least squares, the system determines accurate size distributions within four minutes using six concurrent processing streams. Our prototype successfully measured gold nanoparticles as small as 30 nm from only a 10 µL sample, demonstrating strong potential for accessible nanoparticle diagnostics and micro/nanomaterial synthesis workflows.

## Smartphone spectrometer
<img src="img/spectro.png" width="300" alt="smartphone spectrometer"> <br/>
Investigation of the optical properties of a material, which is based on how the material absorbs, transmits, and reflects light, can be used to study biochemical analytes. The optical spectroscopy is a common scientific instrument for quantifying the light absorbance of analytes. It broke up collected light into various light spectrum components and monitored light intensity as a function of wavelength. 
Advancement in smartphone technology has led to the development of portable, low-cost smartphone-based spectrometers. These devices can be used in various applications, such as food and beverage analysis, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.
