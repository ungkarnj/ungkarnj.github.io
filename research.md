## A portable device for microrheological characterisation
<img src="img/device1.jpg" width="400"> <br/>
We created a tool for characterising microrheological responses(e.g. loss and storage modulus, complex and shear viscosity) for biological fluids such as Human whole blood, Human blood plasma, Bovine serum albumin, Human saliva and so on.

Investigation of the optical properties of a material, which is based on how the material absorbs, transmits, and reflects light, can be used to study biochemical analytes. The optical spectroscopy is a common scientific instrument for quantifying the light absorbance of analytes. It broke up collected light into various light spectrum components and monitored light intensity as a function of wavelength. 
Advancement in smartphone technology has led to the development of portable, low-cost smartphone-based spectrometers. These devices can be used in various applications, such as food and beverage analysis, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.
