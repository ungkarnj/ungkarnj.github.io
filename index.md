# Bibiography

Dr Ungkarn Jarujareet was appointed as a researcher at National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) in Thailand. He took a BEng in Computer Engineering at Thammasat University, Thailand. Then, he continued to undertake MEng at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. In 2021, Dr Ungkarn graduated with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, UK. His PhD developed a scientific instrument to reveal microrheological behaviours of biological fluids under the supervision of Professor Jon Cooper and Dr Julien Reboud and in collaboration with Dr Manlio Tassieri.

# Research Interests
My research interests are in the use of light scattering techniques to investigate microrheological responses of fluids and to retreive size distribution of colloidal micro-nanoparticles. Study of microrheology benefits for manufacturing and life sciences research producing precisely defined materials of interest. Whereas, micro-nano particle sizing to create a tools aiming at detection of protein aggregation and antigen-antibody interactions. Application spans from biological researches to clinical practices.

# Grants
2024 to 2026 - TRF Grant for New Researcher, National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), Principal Investigator.
