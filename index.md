# Bibiography

Dr Ungkarn Jarujareet was appointed as a researcher at National Electronics and Computer Technology Center in Thailand. He took a BEng in Computer Engineering at Thammasat University, Thailand. Then, he continued to undertake MEng at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. In 2021, Dr Ungkarn graduated with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, UK. His PhD developed a scientific instrument to reveal microrheological behaviours of biological fluids under the supervision of Professor Jon Cooper and Dr Julien Reboud and in collaboration with Dr Manlio Tassieri.

# Research Interests
My research interests are in the use of light scattering techniques to investigate microrheological responses of fluids and to retreive size distribution of colloidal micro-nanoparticles. Study of microrheology benefits for manufacturing and life sciences research producing precisely defined materials of interest. Whereas, micro-nano particle sizing to create a tools aiming at detection of protein aggregation and antigen-antibody interactions. Application spans from biological researches to clinical practices.

# Grants
2024 to 2026 - TRF Grant for New Researcher, National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), Principal Investigator.

## A portable device for microrheological characterisation
<img src="img/device1.jpg" width="400"> <br/>
We created a tool for characterising microrheological responses(e.g. loss and storage modulus, complex and shear viscosity) for biological fluids such as Human whole blood, Human blood plasma, Bovine serum albumin, Human saliva and so on.

## Smartphone spectrometer
<img src="img/spectro.png" width="300"> <br/>
Investigation of the optical properties of a material, which is based on how the material absorbs, transmits, and reflects light, can be used to study biochemical analytes. The optical spectroscopy is a common scientific instrument for quantifying the light absorbance of analytes. It broke up collected light into various light spectrum components and monitored light intensity as a function of wavelength. 
Advancement in smartphone technology has led to the development of portable, low-cost smartphone-based spectrometers. These devices can be used in various applications, such as food and beverage analysis, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.
